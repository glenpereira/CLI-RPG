# CLI RPG HACKTOBER FEST
An RPG game on a terminal. 

**YOU MIGHT NEED CODEBLOCKS**

* I've made this as a codeblocks project so it is easy for me to manage.
* Read the readme.md file, I've said a few things there.

Things I'd want a helping hand with:
* Instead of each variable for each location, like int faze, int optic, change it to an integer array called location.
* Clean up all the input buffer code with fflush instead of the complicated while loop
* Make a new questline ??
* Clean up dirty code
* If possible, find a new way to handle quests


Happy Hacktoberfest ‚ù§
