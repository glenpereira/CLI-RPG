# CLI RPG
An RPG game on a terminal. 

I made this to learn and practice about programming. Most things I've done could be done in way more efficient and better way.

**YOU MIGHT NEED CODEBLOCKS**

* I've made this as a codeblocks project so it is easy for me to manage.
* If you have codeblocks, then open the [RPG.cbp](https://github.com/parapsychic/CLI-RPG/tree/master/RPG) file.
* If you don't, [download it here](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries).
* You can try running the [RPG.exe](https://github.com/parapsychic/CLI-RPG/tree/master/RPG/bin/Debug) to see how it works (and breaks) and build upon the existing code.
* At the moment, I've made a quest for you to try out how things work. 
* I've tried commenting almost all piece of code so it is easier to figure things out.

Happy coding ‚ù§
